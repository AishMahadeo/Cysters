# Cysters
This is my BE project i.e PCOS Detection using ML.

- **Cysters** - PCOS Detection using ML.
- Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects a woman's hormone levels. 
- Unmanaged PCOS can impact short and long term health. It’s associated with type 2 diabetes, infertility, cardiovascular disease, obesity, sleep apnea (disrupted breathing in sleep), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and depression.
- Most of the time women are unable to recognize whether they have PCOS or not at it’s early stage and therefore it may get worse day by day.
- To eradicate this serious problem we built this project with motivation to provide a platform for women who feel shy about going to a doctor to check if they have pcos or not.

## Proposed Solution:
- So we have built a platform which takes input from the user and then processes it with the help of Machine Learning algorithm and generates the result as whether the person has pcos or not. 
- In our proposed solution the first step is early detection. 
- The patients would be asked a set of 28 questions suggested by a medical professional. Based on their answers we will detect the result and if PCOS is detected then further the patient would be asked to perform two tests viz. blood test, pelvic ultrasound test.
- The parameters of reports are provided as input again to the Machine Learning Model. It will predict whether  the patient is diagnosed with PCOS or not.
